I received my **B.Eng.** from Remote Sensing Information and Engineering School, **Wuhan university** in 2017, and **Ph.D.** from Electronic Information School, **Wuhan University** in 2023.

I was also a visiting student at School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) of **Queen Mary University of London** between 2021 and 2022, where I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher** since 2024 (Remotely started from 09/2023).
