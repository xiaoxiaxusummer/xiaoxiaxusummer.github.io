I received my **B.Eng.** from Remote Sensing Information and Engineering School, **Wuhan university** in 2017, and **Ph.D.** from Electronic Information School, **Wuhan University** in 2023.
I was also a visiting student at Queen Mary University of London
I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at **Queen Mary University of London** since 2024.  


My research focuses on:

- Emerging antennas (**pinching antenna system (PASS)**, RIS) and multiple access techniques
- AI & machine learning driven optimization
- Large model over wireless network (**mobile edge generation (MEG)**)
