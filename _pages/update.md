## üóìÔ∏è Recent News
- **2025-06-11**: Delivered a talk at ICC 2025 on deploying large model at the edge. [Conference/Journal Paper, to be appear][Slides] (https://github.com/xiaoxiaxusummer/MEGSplitting/blob/main/Optimal%20Energy-Delay%20Tradeoff%20for%20MEG.pdf) [Demo Code](https://github.com/xiaoxiaxusummer/MEGSplitting)
- **2025-04-30**: Preprint available on arXiv: **Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS): Power Radiation Model and Optimal Beamforming Design** [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00218) [Code](https://github.com/xiaoxiaxusummer/PASS_Discrete)üéâ. We proposed: 
	- A novel pinch-wise power control model for pinching antenna
	- Globally optimal pinching beamforming and digital beamforming algorithm for discrete PASS activation
	- A low-complexity  pinching beamforming and digital beamforming algorithm based on matching theory, which demonstrates real near-optimal performance through our experiments
-**2025-03-26**: Paper accepted by *IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking*: **Accelerating Mobile Edge Generation (MEG) by Constrained Learning** [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10955724) [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07245) [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xiaoxiaxu/highresolution-laioncoco-aesthetic-MEG) [HuggingfacePipeline](https://huggingface.co/xiaoxiaxu/LowLatencyMEG_Backbone) [Code](https://github.com/xiaoxiaxusummer/LowLatencyMEG)
We proposed: 
	- A novel joint compression framework to accelerate large model execution for AIGC generation at mobile devices, which optimizes compression ratios of both diffusion steps and transmitted features to achieve tradeoffs between generation quality and latency.  
	- Verified mathematical models of both latency and energy consumption using the proposed collaborative generation framework.
	- An offline distillation mechanism that trains a backbone distributed stable diffusion XL model to support various compression ratios. 
	- A constrained deep reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes compression ratios in online channel environment, which maximizes the generation quality and stringently guarantees end-to-end latency and energy consumption constraints.
